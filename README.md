# Website Repo for DataWave Project
Put together by Marshall Borrus + Niku Darafshi

## Website creation

The site was originally compiled locally on my computer (with Hugo), and was uploaded to Github as files were updated. The website is recompiled at Datawaveproject.github.io every time a file is pushed to the repisitory thanks to some handy internet guides which use a public workflow file to run Hugo online. 

## Website editing

To edit files on the website, you can clone the repository to your local drive, or edit the files using the online editing interface. Email nikud@stanford.edu for editing permisions. 

## To Post a Job

2. Navigate to ./images/ 
a. Upload a square logo of the institution to the /images/ folder if none exists
b. Copy the file name if one already exists (ex: Rice_Square.png)
3. Navigate back to ./Jobs/ and 
a. upload any .pdf files you have

5. Commit changes (publish) and a github pages routine will finish in the background, recompling the site and uploading your new page within a few minutes. If you don't see your new page in 6-7 minutes, clear your cache and cookies and re-load the Datawave page.
